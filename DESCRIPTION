Description: The Oxford Modelling Group for Global Health (OMGH) is developing 
    model structures to estimate the impact of potential mitigation strategies. 
    By changing the input data and parameter values, the models can be adjusted 
    to represent a national or subnational setting. In addition, a user friendly 
    application and interface is being developed to enable widespread utility.
    This package supports in the processing of respective national and/or 
    subnational input data and parameter values into data structures appropriate 
    for use with the modelling application and/or other packages developed for
    this purpose.
